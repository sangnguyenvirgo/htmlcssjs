<p>Toronto students will soon be able to walk along the Great Wall of China or snorkel in the Great Barrier Reef from their classrooms with the Google Expeditions virtual reality field trip experience.<br>
  Local teachers will be the first in Canada to have the opportunity to sign up for the Google Expeditions Pioneer Program in January. Schools that have six or more interested teachers will get one day to try out the virtual teaching tool.<br>
  “One of the key things we’ve heard from teachers is they really wanted to find a way to engage their students meaningfully and find that hook to inspire and get kids excited about learning,” said Jennifer Holland, program manager for education apps at Google.<br>
  Google Expeditions integrates Cardboard with images from Google Earth and Street View, as well as 360 degree footage captured on its Jump cameras.<br>
  The tech giant is gathering feedback from students and teachers during this stage of the project before a planned release of an Expedition app that will be available on devices schools have already purchased later in the school year, said Jennifer Holland, program manager for education apps at Google.<br>
The Expedition library currently includes more than 120 virtual trips to sites including Antarctica, the Acropolis, Chichen Itza, Mars and the Borneo rainforest.</p>
<h1><a id="article2"></a>Article 2</h1>
<p>IN OPEN SOURCING its artificial intelligence engine—freely sharing one of its most important creations with the rest of the Internet—Google showed how the world of computer software is changing.</p>
<p>These days, the big Internet giants frequently share the software sitting at the heart of their online operations. Open source accelerates the progress of technology. In open sourcing its TensorFlow AI engine, Google can feed all sorts of machine-learning research outside the company, and in many ways, this research will feed back into Google.</p>
<p>But Google’s AI engine also reflects how the world of computer hardware is changing. Inside Google, when tackling tasks like image recognition and speech recognition and language translation, TensorFlow depends on machines equipped with GPUs, or graphics processing units, chips that were originally designed to render graphics for games and the like, but have also proven adept at other tasks. And it depends on these chips more than the larger tech universe realizes.</p>
<p>According to Google engineer Jeff Dean, who helps oversee the company’s AI work, Google uses GPUs not only in training its artificial intelligence services, but also in running these services—in delivering them to the smartphones held in the hands of consumers.</p>
<h1><a id="article3"></a>Article 3</h1>
<p>This is why distributing something as unpolished as Google Cardboard in a way that’s as gimmicky (and anachronistic) as handing it out with a newspaper turns out to be such a big deal. Sure, we’re talking about a tiny subset of kids. But they’ll tell their friends. Their parents are already telling their friends. And a technology that once seemed remote is suddenly accessible.</p>
<p>And in the case of this particular technology, accessibility translates almost immediately into visceral intimacy. Experiencing VR for the first time isn’t just cool; it’s revelatory. This is why so many of us made sure to capture the moment of our kids’ first encounter. Most parents, I hope, don’t make videos of their kids’ reactions when we unbox our latest iPhones. But I believe we had a collective sense that our kids were experiencing something meaningfully new—not just an encounter with a new technology, but with a new way of relating to technology.</p>
<p>Especially as a medium for non-fiction, I believe the hype that VR can act as a powerful empathy engine, a uniquely direct way to put us in someone else’s world. This makes me hopeful that VR will become much more than the next level of escapism for an already screen-addled generation. I know that’s some serious parental wishful thinking. But for good or ill, Google Cardboard is just good enough to imprint a new paradigm on a nation of 8-year-olds. From now on, kids who’ve had the VR experience have a new set of expectations of what it should mean to interact with a computer. Imagine what they’ll expect by the time they’re 18.</p>
<h1><a id="article4"></a>Article 4</h1>
  Some have questioned whether the system truly exhibits quantum properties. But researchers at USC say that the system appears to display a phenomenon called “quantum annealing” that suggests it’s truly operating in the quantum realm. Regardless, the D-Wave is not a general quantum computer—that is, it’s not a computer for just any task. But D-Wave says the machine is well-suited to “optimization” problems, where you’re facing many, many different ways forward and must pick the best option, and to machine learning, where computers teach themselves tasks by analyzing large amount of data.</p>
<p>D-Wave says that most of the power needed to run the system is related to the extreme cooling. The entire system consumes about 15 kilowatts of power, while the quantum chip itself uses a fraction of a microwatt. “Most of the power,” Williams says, “is being used to run the refrigerator.” This means that the company can continue to improve its performance without significantly expanding the power it has to use. At the moment, that’s not hugely important. But in a world where classical computers are approaching their limits, it at least provides some hope that the trend can be reversed.</p>
<h1><a id="article5"></a>Article 5</h1>
  Bulk around the clasp is immediately off-putting; even after a few days of letting myself get used to it, the band still felt clunky. I ended up spinning it around, positioning the screen on the inside of my wrist—the clasp-out configuration improves the comfort, but it’s unsightly. Two-button control layout is confusing, and Microsoft probably could have gotten away with using more gestures and just one button. Switching between activities (like starting a bike ride) is a process involving too many swipes, taps, and button-presses. Simplify the design, drop the price.</p>
